  # ASCII Image Converter
<p>Convert images into ASCII art with this simple Python script.</p>


  ## Description

 <p>This Python script effectively converts images into ASCII art. 
  This script takes an image as input, resizes it, converts it to grayscale, 
  and then represents the pixels as ASCII characters.</p>


  ## Features

- **Adjustable Image Size:** Resize images for better ASCII representation.
- **Convert to Grayscale:** Convert images to grayscale for a classic ASCII look.
- **Save ASCII Art:** Save ASCII art to a text file.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/Ascii-Image-Converter
     ```

   - Execute the script:

     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

2. **Enter the Image Path:**
   - Follow the prompts to enter the path to the image you want to convert. If the script doesn't find the file initially, fear not! It will channel its inner detective and attempt to locate the image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

3. **View the ASCII Art:**
   - Marvel at the console as the resulting ASCII art unfolds before your eyes.

4. **Check the Saved Result:**
   - Find the file saved in `ascii_image.txt`. Share it, frame it, or just appreciate your newfound ASCII artistry!

No installation is required for this script other than having Python installed on your machine. The script leverages the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which you can install using the following command:

```bash
pip install pillow
